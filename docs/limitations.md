# Limits and compatibility

## Hardware

- Cardputer ADV uses ESP32-S3FN8: 8 MB flash, 512 KB internal SRAM, and no PSRAM.
- Wi-Fi is 2.4 GHz only.
- Display resolution is 240 × 135 pixels.
- Persistent chats, workspace files, audio, and logs require microSD.
- Release builds pin the M5Stack ESP32 board package to 3.2.1. Version 3.3.9 is not
  supported because it produces a silent microphone stream on Cardputer ADV with the
  pinned M5Unified audio implementation.

## Current firmware limits

- Projects, chats, and Shared workspace files use paginated microSD indexes rather than
  a small in-memory count. A 500-file workspace is exercised by the hardware release
  suite without making 500 a product limit. Bookmark metadata rejects more than
  4,096 entries; that validation ceiling is not a tested operating point on this
  no-PSRAM device.
- Request context is configurable per project from 8 KiB to 256 KiB. The default is
  32 KiB. Complete raw history stays on microSD and does not have a fixed 16- or
  64-message ceiling.
- Project and chat instructions: 16 KiB each. A compacted context summary may use up
  to 128 KiB on microSD.
- A typed or pasted chat prompt is limited to 16 KiB of valid UTF-8.
- Workspace files have no CardMind-specific size ceiling. Available microSD capacity,
  filesystem limits, 32-bit file offsets, and the safe free-space reserve are the
  effective limits. Nested relative UTF-8 paths are supported; absolute paths,
  traversal, control characters, and internal `.tmp`/`.bak` targets are rejected.
- Arbitrary binary files may be stored, downloaded, copied, and transferred over SFTP.
  Editing and model read/append tools require valid UTF-8 text and use bounded internal
  windows of at most 12 KiB per operation.
- QR display: up to 320 UTF-8 bytes. Longer files must be shortened before they can
  be rendered as a QR code on the 240 × 135 display.
- Voice recording: up to 60 seconds. TTS input: up to 5,000 bytes.
- Eight SSH profiles; terminal log rotates at 512 KiB.
- Web sessions expire after 15 minutes of inactivity.

Large files behave as complete files in the UI. The firmware transfers and commits
them incrementally because loading a multi-megabyte document beside Wi-Fi and TLS
state is unsafe. Replacement also needs enough temporary free space plus a small
recovery floor; only the operation that cannot complete is rejected.

## Provider compatibility

Chat requires OpenAI-compatible streaming in the documented delta shape. A service
that only imitates the endpoint path but returns a different SSE schema is not
compatible. STT, TTS, and search are separate optional APIs.

## Python

The full image includes MicroPython as a separate mode. Scripts live in the shared
`/assistant/files` microSD workspace and are limited to 65,536 bytes each. CardMind,
the model's file tools, the normal Web console, and MicroPython all see the same
files. Open **Web Console → Start Python workspace**. Browser launches hand off the
current authenticated session automatically; launches from the Cardputer show the IP
address and installation password before restart.

A model-requested run is a separate one-shot path. It always stops for **Allow once**,
even when Python policy is Allow. Approval covers one normalized project-linked `.py`
path, exact byte size, and SHA-256; review the complete source before approving. A
changed file or identity, another run, or stale approval after restart requires new
approval. Off, Deny, malformed tool input, or lack of one-run approval prevents the
handoff. Before switching modes, CardMind rechecks the approved path, size, SHA-256,
and source. After the switch, MicroPython rechecks the staged request and source before
execution; a mismatch there returns to CardMind without running the script. A later
result-integrity failure may mean effects are unknown; CardMind reports that and never
replays the run.

Approved bytes run as privileged MicroPython code with full device access; this is not
a sandbox. CardMind runs one foreground script, then returns bounded stdout, stderr,
and exit state to the originating chat. The fixed watchdog returns from an ordinary
unresponsive one-shot, but approved privileged code can feed or disable the watchdog or
alter boot behavior. It is recovery for accidental hangs, not a sandbox, containment
boundary, or adversarial timeout guarantee. If execution may already have had effects
but no valid complete result survived, CardMind reports that uncertainty and never
automatically replays the script.

This is MicroPython, not desktop CPython. Native CPython wheels, large data-science
packages, subprocesses, and operating-system APIs are unavailable. Only one user
script runs at a time. A runaway script cannot be force-stopped safely; use **Restart
Python** in the browser or restart the device, then edit the script before running it
again.
